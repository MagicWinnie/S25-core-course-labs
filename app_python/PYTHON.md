# Python Web Application

## ðŸ§© Framework Choice

I have decided to use [FastAPI](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/) framework.

Firstly, I have a lot of experience in it, so writing this application was very quick.  
Secondly, it is a popular framework and it is relatively lightweight.  
Thirdly, I think it is suitable for this application.

## âœ… Best Practices

- Code modularity that will ease the future development.
- `black` and `isort` formatters were used to format the Python code according to PEP 8.
- `pylint` linter and `mypy` static type checker were used to ensure the absense of stupid errors.
- Separated production and development requirements.txt files.
- Using Makefile to structure the different stages of development.
- `markdownlint` was used to check the Markdown files.
