# Go Web Application

## ðŸ§© Framework Choice

I have decided to use [Gin](https://github.com/gin-gonic/gin) framework.

Firstly, it is very easy to create a simple web application.  
Secondly, it is similar to FastAPI in Python.  
Thirdly, it is a popular framework and it is relatively lightweight.  
Fourthly, I think it is suitable for this application.

## ðŸ§ª Testing

Manual testing was performed by opening the webpage and comparing the calculated ages with real ages of myself and other people.

## âœ… Best Practices

- Code modularity that will ease the future development.
- Using popular [project layout](https://github.com/golang-standards/project-layout).
- `gofumpt` formatter with some strict formatting rules was used.
- `golangci-lint` linter was used to ensure the absense of stupid errors.
- Using Makefile to structure the different stages of development.
- `markdownlint` was used to check the Markdown files.
